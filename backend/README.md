# About The Backend
Hello, this backend was developed by Jawad Kabir and <names>. I used a combination of data analysis and ai skills to develop the RAG component of this project. I used a data set (more info can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter?resource=download)) and applied several data cleaning processes to get a question:response formatted dataframe, to which i exported as a csv. This would then be loaded and partition into chunks using LangChain, where we would then apply embeddings and store these into the vector store via ChromaDB. We would then push this ChromaDB alongside a user input as a prompt into our LLM (GPT 3.5)
